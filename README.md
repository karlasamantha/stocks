## Development mode
To run in a local environment, just run the following command:

```js
  npm run start
```

It'll automatically open a new tab on your selected browser on `http://localhost:3000`

## Technologies used
  * create-react-app
  * Styled components
  * Netlify
  * TDS

## General notes

### Why create-react-app?
To reduce time to market when creating a new React application and having an out-of-the-box solution to kickstart the project.

### Why deploy to prod?
As a personal reference, I'd like testing small projects after deployment as it sometimes can occurs different errors then in a local development environment.
