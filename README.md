## General notes

### Why create-react-app?
To reduce time to market when creating a new React application and having an out-of-the-box solution to kickstart the project.

### Why deploy to prod?
As a personal reference, I'd like testing small projects after deployment as it sometimes can occurs different errors then in a local development environment.
